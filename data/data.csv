Director, Met With Kim Jong-un in North Korea",The president alluded to the mission on Tuesday when he said that the United States was in direct talks with North Korea at “extremely high levels.”,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump dispatched the C.I.A. director Mike Pompeo to North Korea to meet with its leader, Kim Jong-un, in recent weeks to lay the groundwork for a summit meeting between Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump, two people briefed on the secret trip said on Tuesday.
Mr. Trump alluded to Mr. Pompeo’s mission when he said on Tuesday afternoon that the United States was in direct talks with North Korea at “extremely high levels,” and that the White House was looking at five sites for a potential meeting of the two leaders.
The White House has used intelligence, rather than diplomatic channels, to communicate with North Korea, ever since last month, when Mr. Trump unexpectedly accepted Mr. Kim’s invitation to meet.
Mr. Pompeo, who is awaiting confirmation as secretary of state, has been dealing with North Korean representatives through a channel that runs between the C.I.A. and its North Korean counterpart, the Reconnaissance General Bureau, according to other officials. And he has been in close touch with the director of South Korea’s National Intelligence Service, Suh Hoon, who American officials said brokered Mr. Kim’s invitation to Mr. Trump.",2018-04-18 00:36:07,,2024-05-15 18:51:02,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/18/us/politics/18dc-prexy1/18dc-prexy1-facebookJumbo-v4.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=e0e972a0d87cdf7c2c7a53932dc3a324c4fb3542dd3cc0906ac04e8ad6766575&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,en

Pompeo's trip, which was first reported by The Washington Post, came to light hours after Trump told reporters that the U.S. and North Korea are holding direct talks at ""extremely high levels"" in preparation for what would be an extraordinary meeting following months of heated rhetoric over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program.
Though the White House did not initially comment on the reports, Trump acknowledged the meeting in a Wednesday morning tweet, saying it went well.
""Mike Pompeo met with Kim Jong Un in North Korea last week. Meeting went very smoothly and a good relationship was formed. Details of Summit are being worked out now. Denuclearization will be a great thing for World, but also for North Korea!"" he tweeted.
Trump, who welcomed Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to his Florida resort Tuesday, said five locations for the potential summit are under consideration. The president would not disclose the sites but said the U.S. was not among them.
""We'll either have a very good meeting or we won't have a good meeting,"" Trump told reporters. ""And maybe we won't even have a meeting at all, depending on what's going in. But I think that there's a great chance to solve a world problem.""
The president did not answer shouted questions about whether he has spoken with Kim.
Kim's offer for a summit was initially conveyed to Trump by South Korea last month, and the president shocked many when it was announced that he had accepted. U.S. officials have indicated over the past two weeks that North Korea's government has communicated directly with Washington that it is ready to discuss its nuclear weapons program.
Abe, who has voiced fears that short- and medium-range missiles that pose a threat to Japan might not be part of the U.S. negotiations, praised Trump on Tuesday for his bravery in agreeing to meet with the North Korean dictator.
""I'd like to commend Donald's courage in his decision to have the upcoming summit meeting with the North Korean leader,"" Abe said.
Trump also confirmed that North and South Korea are working to negotiate an end to hostilities before next week's meeting between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae In. The meeting will be the third inter-Korean summit since the Koreas' 1945 division.
North Korea has long sought a peace treaty with the U.S. to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War. But it is unusual for the North to seek to broach the issue directly with South Korea rather than with Washington. The armistice that ended the fighting was signed by the United Nations Command — the U.S.-led forces in the conflict — North Korea and China. South Korea was a member of the U.N. Command but was not a direct signatory.
Trump said Tuesday that the two Koreas ""have my blessing to discuss the end of the war.""

Pompeo made the trip for high-level talks to discuss the planned bilateral meeting with Trump later this year. The news was first reported by the Washington Post.
Trump announced on March 13 his decision to fire Rex Tillerson and replace him with Pompeo, but the CIA director is still waiting for a confirmation vote from the Senate. Tillerson left the State Department on March 22.
During his confirmation hearings on Thursday, Pompeo told U.S. Senators on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that he was “optimistic” that the government could set Trump up for success.
The president hinted that “direct talks at very high levels” had already taken place with North Korea, while hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.
He denied personally speaking to Jong-un via the White House press office.
Trump appeared eager to conclude a successful negotiation with North Korea, although he autioned that the meeting could be canceled at any time.
“There’s a great chance to solve a world problem,” He told reporters. “This is not a problem for the United States. This is not a problem for Japan or any other country.

Comey, the former F.B.I. director.","WASHINGTON — President Trump spoke in intimate and candid terms to the former F.B.I. director James Comey about some of the most sensitive matters before the agency, including the salacious dossier detailing Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia and the investigation into Michael T. Flynn, the president’s first national security adviser, according to Mr. Comey’s closely guarded memos.
The redacted and declassified memos — running 15 pages in total, and sent to Congress from the Justice Department on Thursday night — detail a series of phone calls and encounters between the two men in the months leading up to Mr. Comey’s firing. They offer an extraordinary look at the private interactions among leaders at the highest levels of government.
[Read the memos here.]
Mr. Trump seized on the memos in a Twitter message posted late Thursday to repeat what has become a constant refrain, that there was “NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION.”",2018-04-20 02:13:45,,2024-05-15 18:51:04,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/21/us/politics/21dc-comey-takaways/21dc-comeyexcerpts-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=96d52f40c0a956c29ecf4addf75b6243f431a62abed1b732c8833ba4ff8323cf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,en
1,R,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/04/20/trump-tweets-that-comey-memos-clearly-show-no-obstruction-collusion.html,"Trump tweets that Comey memos ‘clearly’ show no obstruction, collusion",Memos written by former FBI Director James Comey about his interactions with President Trump showed that the president repeatedly asked Comey to make public that he was not under investigation over contacts between Russian officials and members of his campaign.,"President Trump late Thursday tweeted that the newly released memos written by former FBI Director James Comey “show clearly” no collusion with Russia in 2016 and no obstruction into the investigation.
The memos, which were written by Comey about his interaction with Trump, prove that the fired FBI director never felt obstructed, GOP lawmakers said. Many Democrats claim that Trump tried to hold up the FBI’s investigation into alleged collusion leading up to the 2016 election.
“James Comey Memos just out show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION. Also, he leaked classified information. WOW! Will the Witch Hunt continue?” Trump tweeted.
The memos also showed that eight days after he was sworn in as president, Trump told Comey during a one-on-one dinner at the White House that he ""needed loyalty and expected loyalty.""
Comey wrote that he ""did not reply, or even nod or change my facial expression, which [Trump] noted because we came back to it later."" At a later point, Comey wrote that Trump told him directly, ""I need loyalty.""
""I replied that he would always get honesty from me,"" said Comey. ""[Trump] paused and said that's what he wants, 'honest loyalty.' I replied, 'you will get that from me.'""
""It is possible we understood that phrase differently,"" Comey added as a parenthetical, ""but I chose to understand it as consistent with what I had said throughout the conversation: I will serve the President with loyalty to the office, the country, and the truth. I decided it would not be productive to push the subject further.""
More than two months later, on March 30, Comey wrote that Trump had called him and pressed the FBI director to make public that the president was not under investigation over contacts between Russian officials and members of his campaign.
""I reminded [Trump] that I had told him we weren't investigating him and that I had told the Congressional leadership the same thing,"" Comey wrote. ""[Trump] said it would be great if that could get out and several times asked me to find a way to get that out.""
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Va.; House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C.; and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said in a joint statement that Comey's memos ""show the President made clear he wanted allegations of collusion, coordination, and conspiracy between his campaign and Russia fully investigated.
""The memos also made clear the 'cloud' President Trump wanted lifted was not the Russian interference in the 2016 election cloud, rather it was the salacious, unsubstantiated allegations related to personal conduct leveled in the dossier"" compiled by ex-British spy Christopher Steele, they added.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., disagreed, tweeting that the memos ""are further proof of [Trump's] contempt for the rule of law.
""His attempts to intimidate, circumvent the law & undermine integrity of law enforcement investigations demand immediate action to protect the Mueller investigation,"" she said.
The assurance from Comey that Trump was not being investigated seemed to have weighed on the president's mind as Michael Flynn was fired as national security adviser after misleading Vice President Mike Pence about contacts with the Russian envoy to the U.S.
Trump told Comey during their March 30 conversation that ""if there was 'some satellite' (NOTE: I took this to mean some associate of his or his campaign) that did something, it would be good to find that out, but that he hadn't done anything,"" Comey recalled.
Comey said Trump restated at the end of their conversation that the president ""hoped I could find a way to get out that he wasn't being investigated.
""I told him I would see what we could do and that we would do the work well and as quickly as we could,"" Comey said he responded.
Goodlatte, Gowdy and Nunes noted that Comey ""never wrote that he felt obstructed or threatened,"" adding that while Comey ""went to great lengths to set dining room scenes, discuss height requirements, describe the multiple times he felt complimented, and myriad other extraneous facts, he never once mentioned the most relevant fact of all, which was whether he felt obstructed in his investigation.""
Trump called Comey again on April 11 to ask ""if I did what he had asked last time -- getting out that he personally is not under investigation."" Comey says he advised Trump to have White House Counsel Don McGahn call then-Acting Attorney General Dana Boente to request that such a statement be made.
After Trump said he would do so, Comey said the president told him, ""I have been very loyal to you, very loyal, we had that thing, you know.""
""I did not reply, or ask him what he meant by 'that thing,'"" wrote Comey, who added that as Trump ended the call, the president told him he was ""doing a great job and wished me well.""
During their Jan. 27 dinner in the Green Room, Comey wrote that Trump ""thought maybe he should ask me to investigate"" salacious allegations ""to prove [the dossier] was a lie.""
Comey wrote that ""it was up to [Trump], but I wouldn't want to create a narrative that we were investigating him, because we are not and I worried such a thing would be misconstrued.""
""My sense is that [the president] was focused on the personal piece [of the dossier],"" Comey told MSNBC Thursday night. ""He would bring it up to me repeatedly.""

“James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Also, he leaked classified information. WOW! Will the Witch Hunt continue?”
The 15 pages of Comey’s memos include details not included in the former FBI director’s book and were released by Republican Congressional intelligence officials on Thursday night.
“Former Director Comey never wrote that he felt obstructed or threatened,” read a joint statement from House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, House Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy, and House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes upon the declassified release of the memos. “While former Director Comey went to great lengths to set dining room scenes, discuss height requirements, describe the multiple times he felt complimented, and myriad other extraneous facts, he never once mentioned the most relevant fact of all, which was whether he felt obstructed in his investigation.”
Despite the memos’ declassification, some of the material was redacted, raising questions about whether Comey leaked classified information to a private citizen in the hopes of sparking a special prosecutor of the Russian investigation.
The Republican officials noted that Comey held Trump to a different standard, by writing detailed memos about his conversations with Trump, while failing to do the same for conversations with Democrats.
“Former Director Comey leaked at least one of these memos for the stated purpose of spurring the appointment of Special Counsel, yet he took no steps to spur the appointment of Special Counsel when he had significant concerns about the objectivity of the Department of Justice under Attorney General Loretta Lynch,” the statement read.",2018-04-20 04:49:50,,2024-05-15 18:51:05,https://media.breitbart.com/media/2017/06/jc.png,en

Before we start singing “Give Peace a Chance” and celebrating a victory by the Trump administration for forcing Kim to back down, let’s pause. Remember that Kim simply made a statement – and he has a long record of lying and breaking promises on the nuclear issue and other issues.
While Kim’s conciliatory words are certainly welcome, there’s no way of knowing whether he will actually do what he claims.
Before we start singing “Give Peace a Chance” and celebrating a victory by the Trump administration for forcing Kim to back down, let’s pause. Remember that Kim simply made a statement – and he has a long record of lying and breaking promises on the nuclear issue and other issues.
At this point, Kim has given away absolutely nothing. All he has to do is give an order and North Korea can resume testing nuclear weapons and missiles again.
And of critical importance, Kim gave no indication he plans to destroy his small but devastating nuclear arsenal and missiles that he has already developed – or his large conventional armed forces and armaments. He already has the ability to kill millions of people with the nuclear weapons and missiles that he has on hand, without developing any new ones.
Kim may simply be trying to show signs that he is willing to make major concessions to have better relations with the United States, South Korea and Japan, along with the international community. He has plenty of reasons to be on his best behavior over the next few weeks, showing that he can be reasonable, rational and open to a long-term détente.
The North Korean leader will meet on Friday in the week ahead with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. And plans are underway for the first-ever meeting between U.S. and North Korean leaders in coming weeks.
Remember the cold hard reality of what we witnessed back in 2017. Kim might not need to conduct many more missile or nuclear tests to know he can hit targets in the U.S. homeland.
Kim tested three intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) – part of a sprint of over 20 missile tests last year – that showed North Korea had the range and technological prowess to strike as far as New York City and even Washington, D.C.
In September, Kim also tested a hydrogen bomb – the most destructive of all nuclear weapons. One of these bombs could wipe any U.S. city off the map, with horrific casualties.
So Kim is now very close to having a fully capable, albeit tiny, nuclear force with global reach. All that is needed is the ability for his warheads to re-enter the Earth’s atmosphere and land on target.
And we know, at least according to one report, that Kim has at least a crude capability to see his warheads survive the massive heat and wind shears to rain down atomic terror on his enemies.
So what does this all mean?
Since Kim last tested an ICBM – or any missile – in November, he has had months of lab research time to perfect even more of his nuclear weapons arsenal and missiles.
Kim may have gambled that announcing a closure of his atomic testing grounds and suspending missile and nuclear weapons tests will gain him tremendous international goodwill, a meeting with the U.S. president – and result in him losing nothing.
Kim could easily start to test missiles at any time he wishes. And he doesn’t need missiles flying all throughout Northeast Asia to perfect the targeting, guidance, command and control and heatshield technology of his nuclear delivery systems in small ways.
Perfecting all these things could have very big results months or years down the line if Kim decides to change his mind and begin missile testing again.
The same goes for nuclear weapons. Just because Kim closes his nuclear testing area doesn’t mean he can’t open it back up again. The testing site – a series of carefully crafted deep underground tunnels that took time to construct – is not a sophisticated lab. So let’s not get carried away and be so impressed.
Again, as I noted just recently in a Fox News Opinion piece, what Kim is likely doing is setting the craftiest of traps – one designed to suck the Trump administration into months or years of negotiations.
All the while, Kim’s scientists are working to perfect his deadly arsenal of weapons of mass destruction – not just nuclear weapons, but also chemical and likely biological weapons as well.
The Trump administration must move past Kim’s dramatic announcement that was designed to pull at our emotions and make us hopeful that peace is at hand.
We must demand deeds, because as the old saying goes, actions speak louder than words. Particularly in Kim’s case.
For example, the Trump administration should insist on a roadmap whereby Kim lays out how he will get rid of his nuclear weapons for good – before any U.S.-North Korea summit.
Any agreement with the North should be contingent on international inspectors having 24-hour access to all parts of North Korea – with no site off limits and no notification of access. If inspectors are not allowed to go anywhere, anytime in North Korea without notice there is no real basis for a deal.
Also, any lifting of the international maximum pressure campaign on North Korea must be contingent on Kim making measured and definable progress on giving up his nukes. He must give verifiable proof that he is getting rid of his atomic arsenal to see economic sanctions lifted.
While I am hopeful that Kim could really be sincere in giving up his nukes, public declarations and easily reversed measures are meaningless. I can only hope the Trump administration sees it the same way.",2018-04-20 21:45:00,,2024-05-15 18:51:06,http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/04/20/694940094001_5774108508001_5774105579001-vs.jpg,en
2,RR,http://www.breitbart.com/national-security/2018/04/20/north-korean-state-media-claims-shutdown-nuclear-program/,Reports: North Korean State Media Announced Nuclear Program Shutdown,Various reports in American and South Korean state media Friday evening indicated that North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un announced the halt of nuclear and missile tests in his country. The reports did not specify whether the tests would conclude permanently.,"Various reports in American and South Korean state media Friday evening indicated that North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un announced the halt of nuclear and missile tests in his country. The reports did not specify whether the tests would conclude permanently.
The South Korean newswire service Yonhap reports that the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) published the announcement from Kim, which read, “from April 21, North Korea will stop nuclear tests and launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles.”
“The North will shut down a nuclear test site in the country’s northern side to prove the vow to suspend nuclear test,” the announcement concluded.
NK News, a website focusing on updates from the communist country, reported that Kim told a Workers’ Party of Korea (WPK) meeting that there was “no need” for such a nuclear program anymore.
Reuters also confirmed the KCNA report. Sputnik, a Russian state site, added the detail North Korea will “join international efforts to halt nuclear tests altogether,” according to Kim.
At press time, the report does not appear on the aggregator of North Korean media content KCNA Watch (KCNA’s website has long ceased to be available in the United States).
The announcement follows the debut of a historic direct hotline between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who will meet Kim next Friday in the border town of Panmunjom, Kim’s first visit to South Korea. The two nations agreed to a live broadcast of the summit, which reports have indicated would focus on the possibility of ending the Korean War – technically still ongoing, despite being at a stalemate – and the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” a phrase that some have speculated North Korea will interpret to mean a diminished U.S. presence on the site. Kim reportedly told South Korean officials in a March meeting that denuclearization was father Kim Jong-il’s “dying wish.”
North Korea remains the world’s most prolific human rights abuser, strictly punishing citizens – with death or extended labor camp sentences for attempting to access Western media. Christian North Koreans, or those caught within the vicinity of Bibles, are routinely imprisoned and tortured. North Koreans are forced into a strict caste system known as songbun, in which multiple generations of families can be punished with poverty should any one member be suspected of opposing the Kim regime.
President Donald Trump is preparing to meet Kim in person at a summit in May or early June, according to the White House. No meeting between a U.S. leader and a Kim dynasty dictator has occurred since Kim Il-Sung founded the communist state in 1948.",2018-04-20 22:31:03,,2024-05-15 18:51:06,https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/04/wi/ap/18/96vcqb_trump-us-japan-95573-president-donald-trump-speaks-news-conference-japanese.jpg,en

The 66-page complaint, filed in federal court in New York, uses the publicly known facts of the investigation into Russia’s election meddling to accuse Mr. Trump’s associates of illegally working with Russian intelligence agents to interfere with the outcome of the election. In the document, the committee accuses Republicans and the Russians of “an act of previously unimaginable treachery.”
The sweeping lawsuit startled Republicans in Washington as well as Democratic leaders, who were only briefed at the last minute about the D.N.C.’s plans to pursue civil litigation. Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic Party, said the committee had alerted Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrats in Congress, “when we were about to file.”",2018-04-20 16:08:04,,2024-05-15 18:51:06,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/21/us/politics/21dc-dems1/21dc-dems1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=3e466545660a0713ad1b3c3a54acf6d46fc9c453f1dd1ebce92f01e008d0ed77&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,en

Calling it an “all-out assault on our democracy,” the Democratic National Committee filed the civil suit in federal district court in Manhattan. The suit amounts to another legal broadside related to the 2016 race, on top of the special counsel's ongoing Russia probe and the FBI raid on Trump's personal attorney last week.
""The conspiracy constituted an act of previously unimaginable treachery: the campaign of the presidential nominee of a major party in league with a hostile foreign power to bolster its own chance to win the Presidency,"" the suit states.
President Trump fired back hours later via Twitter, calling the suit ""good news.""
Just heard the Campaign was sued by the Obstructionist Democrats,"" he tweeted. ""This can be good news in that we will now counter for the DNC Server that they refused to give to the FBI, the Debbie Wasserman Schultz Servers and Documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton Emails.""
'During the 2016 presidential campaign, Russia launched an all-out assault on our democracy, and it found a willing and active partner in Donald Trump's campaign.' — DNC Chairman Tom Perez
The new suit claims that Trump campaign officials worked in tandem with the Russian government and its military spy agency to bring down Hillary Clinton by hacking into the computer networks of the DNC and spreading stolen material.
“During the 2016 presidential campaign, Russia launched an all-out assault on our democracy, and it found a willing and active partner in Donald Trump’s campaign,” said DNC Chairman Tom Perez in a statement, calling the alleged collusion “an act of unprecedented treachery.”
The suit names several Trump campaign aides who met with Russian nationals during the campaign, including son-in-law Jared Kushner, campaign chair Paul Manafort and campaign deputy Rick Gates.
“In the Trump campaign, Russia found a willing and active partner,” the suit claims. “In 2016, individuals tied to the Kremlin notified the Trump campaign that Russia intended to interfere with our democracy. Through multiple meetings, emails, and other communications, these Russian agents made clear that their government supported Trump and was prepared to use stolen emails and other information to damage his opponent and the Democratic Party.”
Gates and Manafort have both been charged in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
The suit also claims Wikileaks founder Julian Assange “shared the defendants’ common goal of damaging the Democratic Party in advance of the election.” The suit states Russia, using WikiLeaks, would disseminate information stolen from the DNC “at times when it would best suit the Trump campaign.”
Brad Parscale, campaign manager of Donald J. Trump for President, Inc., slammed the suit as “frivolous” and predicted it would eventually be dismissed.
“This is a sham lawsuit about a bogus Russian collusion claim filed by a desperate, dysfunctional, and nearly insolvent Democratic Party,” Parscale said in a written statement. “With the Democrats’ conspiracy theories against the President’s campaign evaporating as quickly as the failing DNC’s fundraising, they’ve sunk to a new low to raise money, especially among small donors who have abandoned them.”
Trump has strongly – and repeatedly – denied colluding with the Russians.
Most recently, he cited the newly released memos from former FBI boss James Comey to assert his innocence and decry the Russia probe itself.
""James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION. Also, he leaked classified information. WOW! Will the Witch Hunt continue?"" he tweeted.
While the FBI recently raided Trump’s personal attorney Michael Cohen’s home, office and hotel room to seize a collection of documents, a source said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein assured that Trump was not a target of that probe.
Trump’s legal team, meanwhile, is expanding with the addition of former federal prosecutor and New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, who is vowing to seek a swift resolution to the special counsel probe.
As for the latest court action, suing a foreign country could be difficult for Democrats because typically, other nations have immunity from most U.S. lawsuits. However, the suit argues that Russia shouldn’t be entitled to sovereign immunity because the “DNC claims arise out of Russia’s trespass on to the DNC’s private servers … in order to steal trade secrets and commit economic espionage.”
The Democratic Party used a similar tactic during the Watergate scandal in 1972. The DNC sued former President Richard Nixon’s reelection committee for $1 million in damages for the bungled burglary at the Democratic headquarters in the Watergate building.

The multi-million dollar lawsuit comes just one week after Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein reportedly told President Trump he is not the target of either the special counsel’s Russian meddling and collusion probe, or the target of the investigation into his personal attorney Michael D. Cohen.
According to the Washington Post, who first reported the DNC’s lawsuit, it does not name Trump as a defendant, but alleges that various Russian contacts with the campaign amounted to collusion — a theory pushed by Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) for months.
In addition, former FBI Director James Comey’s new book — which was highly anticipated in light of allegations of obstruction of justice — has not yielded the smoking gun Trump critics had hoped for.
“I have one perspective on the behavior I saw, which while disturbing and violating basic norms of ethical leadership, may fall short of being illegal,” Comey wrote in his book.
However, the DNC could be hoping that the lawsuit will invigorate the Russian collusion theory, helping to raise funds ahead of the election. Democrats for months have been soliciting donations based off of the Mueller probe.
The DNC is alleging, in a complaint filed in federal district court in Manhattan, that top Trump campaign officials “conspired” with the Russian government and its military spy agency to hurt Hillary Clinton and help Trump, but hacking the email servers of the Democratic National Committee and disseminating them, according to the Post.
DNC Chairman Tom Perez said in a statement: “During the 2016 presidential campaign, Russia launched an all-out assault on our democracy, and it found a willing and active partner in Donald Trump’s campaign.”
“This constituted an act of unprecedented treachery: the campaign of a nominee for President of the United States in league with a hostile foreign power to bolster its own chance to win the presidency,” he said.
The DNC argues that the cyberattack undermined its ability to communicate with voters, collect donations and operate effectively as its employees faced personal harassment and death threats.
The Post noted that suing Russia presents legal challenges, since other nations have immunity from most U.S. lawsuits. The suit reportedly seeks an acknowledgment from the defendants that they conspired to infiltrate Democrats’ computers, steal information, and disseminate it to influence the 2016 election — essentially, the Democrats’ core collusion claims.

Jonathan Ernst/Reuters
WASHINGTON ― As Republicans in 2016 hammered then-President Barack Obama’s nuclear agreement with Iran, their party’s foreign policy leaders and even many of the GOP candidates themselves understood that the deal, while not ideal, was worth keeping.
Somebody, it seems, forgot to give candidate Donald Trump the memo.
Two years later and still bashing the agreement, Trump is now on track to effectively end it next month ― with an unintended possible consequence of triggering a resumption of the Iranian nuclear program.

“The Iran deal is a terrible deal. We paid $150 billion. We gave $1.8 billion in cash. That’s actual cash, barrels of cash. It’s insane. It’s ridiculous. It should have never been made,” Trump said earlier this week ― once again repeating his false and misleading claims from the campaign trail.
“I strongly doubt he understands or is even aware of the most straightforward parts of the agreement,” said Richard Nephew, a top State Department official in charge of Iran sanctions during the period the agreement was being negotiated.
The 2015 deal Obama’s State Department reached with Iran forced that nation to dismantle its nuclear enrichment program for at least a decade in return for the suspension of some economic sanctions. The deal’s other signatories include France, the United Kingdom and Germany, as well as the European Union, Russia and China.
But for Republicans running for president in 2015 and early 2016, the correct position on the Iran deal was simple: oppose it, the more vociferously, the better.

The deal was achieved by Obama. The Republican primary voting base hated Obama. Anything Obama did, therefore, was by definition bad and had to be undone quickly.
“I strongly doubt [Trump] understands or is even aware of the most straightforward parts of the agreement.” - Richard Nephew, former State Department official
But even as GOP presidential candidates lambasted the deal, Republican foreign policy leaders on Capitol Hill understood that an international agreement that put the Iranian nuclear program on hold through at least 2025 was better than no deal at all. They passed a law that allowed Obama to go forward with the agreement while also providing political cover to Republicans who believed they needed it.
“The GOP votes in 2015, especially in the Senate, were relatively safe ones because it allowed a lot of anti-Obama, anti-Iran and pro-Israel posturing without actually owning the consequences of the deal collapsing, including a very real prospect of another major war in the Middle East,” said Colin Kahl, former Vice President Joe Biden’s national security adviser.
Among the established GOP presidential candidates in the field, though, there was little chance of the deal collapsing.

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, even Texas Sen. Ted Cruz ― they and others, had they won the presidency, almost certainly would have stayed in the agreement, said Rick Tyler, a Republican political consultant who worked for Cruz.
“They probably would have looked at it and thought: What’s best for the country?” he said. “I don’t know anybody who would have ripped up the deal.”
That, of course, was not the public position of the candidates in the summer of 2015 and through the primary season the following winter and spring.
And if Trump was woefully ill-informed about the Iran deal then, his views did not emerge from a vacuum. Rather, they tracked congressional Republicans’ attacks on the agreement, which were then amplified by candidates seeking the GOP nomination, which were then further escalated by Fox News hosts and others in the right-wing media ecosystem.
“Our president has betrayed Israel,” Rubio said at a March 5, 2016 rally in Florida. “On my first day in office, I’m going to cancel the Iran deal,” he said two days later.

“If a guy is threatening to cut your throat, don’t buy him a knife,” South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said at a Feb. 10, 2016 town hall. “This Iran deal is the worst deal.”
Cruz promised literal violence to the agreement itself. “Day one, I will rip to shreds the Iran deal,” he repeated at a North Carolina rally on March 7, 2016.
Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee went even further, essentially accusing Obama of enabling the eventual genocide of Israelis. “It is so naive that he would trust the Iranians. By doing so he will take the Israelis and march them to the door of the oven,” he said on July 26, 2015.
Right-wing media, meanwhile, described the agreement as literally giving Iran nuclear weapons as well as billions of dollars of U.S. taxpayer cash.
In fact, the agreement has forced Iran to give up most of its nuclear material as well as dismantle the machinery it could use to manufacture more. The $1.7 billion the United States gave to Iran was money it held in U.S. banks at the time of the 1979 revolution, plus accrued interest, which had been frozen there by U.S. sanctions for the next three and a half decades.

Whether Trump understood that during the campaign, or even if he understands it now, is not clear. Trump famously bragged at one point that he did not study issues like NATO, even as he went on to describe his strong opinions about NATO. In August 2015, Trump told NBC News that he learned military policy from “the shows” ― television news and interview programs.
One Republican adviser close to the White House said on condition of anonymity that Trump has made no effort since taking office to inform himself ― not on the Iran deal or policy issues generally. “He doesn’t know,” the adviser said. “And he doesn’t care.”
Trump’s former top foreign policy advisers unanimously supported staying in the Iran deal. But administration shakeups in the past two months have brought interventionists like John Bolton and Mike Pompeo aboard. AOL
The Iran deal is just one instance where Trump’s not knowing or caring about policy has put his administration in a bind.
On the campaign trail, he repeatedly promised he would repeal Obamacare and replace it with a plan that would both offer everyone better coverage and cost far less ― an absurd claim on its face. Only after he was in office did he acknowledge that the task perhaps wasn’t that simple. “Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated,” he said in February 2017.

Trump’s promise to rip up the Iran agreement actually began causing heartburn even earlier, within days of his taking office.
After Iran tested a long-range missile ― something not covered by the agreement ― then-national security adviser Michael Flynn went before the White House press corps to deliver a bellicose response. But just hours later, top National Security Council staff in a briefing with those same reporters acknowledged that Iran was still complying with the agreement and said that the United States would continue to comply as well.
Under the lran deal legislation passed by Congress, Trump must certify every 90 days whether Iran is in compliance to prevent the reapplication of U.S. sanctions. Trump did this twice since taking office but made it clear he was unhappy about not being able to fulfill his campaign promise. Last October, he refused to certify that Iran was in compliance, bringing about the new, May 12 deadline about whether to re-impose sanctions.
During his first year in office, Trump’s top foreign policy advisers unanimously supported staying in the Iran deal. But in the past two months, Trump has fired national security adviser H.R. McMaster and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, leaving Defense Secretary Jim Mattis as the sole major voice for keeping the deal.
Trump’s new national security adviser, John Bolton, has been best known in recent years for broadcasting his pro-interventionist views on Iran and other countries in his Fox News appearances. And newly confirmed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, as a Kansas congressman in December 2015, told a Westminster Institute audience that the only real solution in Iran was “the abolition of the current regime.”

Given that shift in the Trump administration’s policy-making lineup and Iran’s threat to resume its nuclear program should the United States re-impose sanctions, a top priority of both French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in their White House visits this week has been to persuade Trump to remain in the agreement.
During his visit earlier this week, Macron tried to appeal to Trump’s fondness for largeness, selling the idea that the deal could be made bigger and better by adding on agreements that dealt with missile technology and Iran’s role in funding regional conflicts. Merkel is to repeat that message Friday, according to Western European diplomats.
Whether their words have any effect remains to be seen. Trump has already ignored U.S. allies on tariffs and the Paris climate agreement because he believes those issues are important to his loyal supporters, even as his popularity has plummeted among everybody else, according to those close to him.
Ironically, it is precisely that cult-like loyalty that could give Trump a path to preserving the deal without losing any support, said Tyler, the former campaign aide to Cruz.
“The Iran deal used to be important to the ideologically based Republican Party, which no longer exists,” Tyler said. “Trump’s supporters are not paying attention to policy in any deep way.

Hosting President Emmanuel Macron of France at the White House, Mr. Trump again assailed the agreement made by the Obama administration as “insane” and “ridiculous,” but said he could agree to “a new deal” negotiated by American and European officials if it was strong enough. He made no commitment, however, leaving it unclear whether he will pull out of the agreement by a May 12 deadline he has set to either “fix” the Iran agreement or walk away from it.
At the same time, Mr. Trump signaled more optimism about brokering a nuclear accord with North Korea as he prepares for a summit meeting with its leader, Kim Jong-un, in May or early June. Dispensing with harsh criticism of the past, Mr. Trump even praised Mr. Kim in strikingly positive terms, calling the head of one of the world’s most authoritarian governments “very open and very honorable.”
The discussion with Mr. Macron illustrated how the separate nuclear standoffs with Iran and North Korea have increasingly intersected, with far-reaching consequences for American foreign policy in the Middle East, Asia and Europe. Mr. Trump’s decision next month to keep or dump the Iran nuclear agreement will inevitably influence the anticipated talks with North Korea just days or weeks later as Mr. Kim weighs whether he can reach a deal with the American president.",2018-04-24 14:35:57,,2024-05-15 18:51:08,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/25/us/politics/25dc-prexy/25dc-prexy-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=20daca109b749bbaf235614fc6c72f1a03a83ed186ed481df22e032fd8e3fbc2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,en

He also stood by his criticism of the Obama-era nuclear pact as visiting French President Emmanuel Macron lobbied him to preserve it.
In a joint-press conference at the White House Tuesday afternoon, Trump doubled-down on comments he made earlier in the day, issuing a warning to Iran.
“If Iran threatens us in any way, they will pay a price like no country has ever paid,” Trump said, noting that when the Obama administration made the Iran deal in 2015, they “should have made a deal that covered Yemen, Syria and other parts of the Middle East where Iran is involved.”
Meanwhile, Macron said that he was unclear what Trump would decide in terms of the deal. He must announce a decision whether to re-certify on May 12.
“[I hope] we can combine our common views and differences. [I have] always said we should not tear apart JCPOA and have nothing else—that would not be a good solution,” Macron said. “It’s not about tearing apart the agreement, but about building something new that will cover all concerns.”
Earlier Tuesday, Trump held an Oval Office meeting with Macron where they discussed several important foreign policy issues – including the Iran Nuclear deal.
“People know my view. It is a terrible deal that should have never been made,” Trump said during the meeting. “Iran seems to be behind everything where there is a problem. You look at what’s happening, in any—virtually any place in the Middle East, and Iran is behind it.”
Trump delayed the decision to re-certify the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement, which lifts economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for winding down their nuclear program. The president is expected to make a decision on the future of the Obama-era program on May 12.
Early Tuesday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani warned the U.S. there would be “grave” consequences if the U.S. withdraws from the nuclear agreement between Tehran and world powers, noting that Iran would “strongly resist” any plans for the U.S. to withdraw.
But when asked what the U.S. strategy would be should Iran restart their nuclear program, Trump warned that it “won’t be so easy to restart.”
“If they restart their nuclear program, they’re going to have big problems—bigger than they’ve ever had before,” Trump said Tuesday.
Trump and first lady Melania Trump welcomed Macron and his wife to the White House Tuesday morning in their first formal state visit, ahead of a day of foreign policy discussions for the U.S. and France.
Macron, along with his wife Brigitte Macron, was greeted by the Trumps, Vice President Pence, Cabinet officials, lawmakers and nearly 500 U.S. service members from all five military branches.
""Melania and I were honored to visit your country last summer, and now are thrilled to host you and Brigitte here in America,"" Trump said at the White House upon Macron's arrival. ""The wonderful friendship we've developed is a testament to an enduring friendship that binds our two nations.""
Trump added that ""it is truly fitting that we are holding our first official state visit with the leader of America's oldest ally, the proud nation of France.""
Trump and Macron met in a more casual setting on Monday, featuring a helicopter tour of Washington and a visit to Mount Vernon. But Tuesday is slated for serious policy discussions, following French and British support as the U.S. launched airstrikes into Syria in the wake of a deadly chemical attack this month.
“Your visit comes at a critical time for alliance,” Trump said Tuesday on the White House lawn. “The United States, France and the United Kingdom took decisive action in response to the Syrian regime’s use of chemical weapons.”
FRANCE'S MACRON SUGGESTS TRUMP CANNOT 'MAKE WAR' AGAINST EVERYBODY, EVERYTHING
Trump said he wanted to “personally thank” Macron, the French military and the people for their “partnership.” Trump also said ""now is the time for strength.""
""So let us be strong and united, let us honor our past and face our future with confidence and pride,"" Trump said. ""And let the U.S. and France stand forever in solidarity for the noble causes of liberty and peace.""
Macron gave remarks following the president's, which were delivered in French with an English translation.
""Thank you for honoring this visit, the first of your presidency, which bears witness to the strength that unites our two countries,"" Macron said, adding that America ""represents endless possibilities"" for France.
""It is together that we shall build a new form of prosperity for all peoples, free and fair trade, and the protection of all classes,"" Macron said, adding that ""together we will be able to act effectively for our planet.""
Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Accord last year, but Macron noted he was ""not just referring to climate.""
""On this issue, we don't always agree, but in the end, such is the case in any family or friendship,"" Macron said. ""It is together that we can resist the rise of aggressive nationalisms that divide our history and world. Together, we will build new strong multilateralism that defends democracy in the fate of ill winds.""
Macron touted the relationship between the U.S. and France under the Trump administration as having ""constantly grown more solid.""

“You’ll find out about that. It won’t be so easy for them to restart. They’re not going to be restarting anything. They restart it, they’re going to have big problems, bigger than they’ve ever had before,” Trump said during his meeting with Macron at the White House.
The Iranians warned that if the United States withdrew from the deal, they would restart their efforts to develop nuclear weapons.
Trump repeated that the deal reached under the Obama administration was a “terrible deal.”
“It’s insane. It’s ridiculous,” Trump said when asked by reporters about the deal. “It should never have been made, but we will be talking about it.”
Macron said the Iran deal was an important part of stabilizing the region, pointing out that it was important to contain Iranian influence.
Trump agreed that Iran was a problem.
“It just seems that no matter where you go, especially in the Middle East, Iran is behind it. Wherever there’s trouble — Yemen, Syria, no matter where you have it — Iran is behind it,” he said.
He added that, “unfortunately,” Russia was also getting more involved in the region.
Trump ridiculed former Secretary of State John Kerry for not addressing other important issues in the Iran deal at the time of the agreement.

Donald Trump will visit London in July despite the threat of protests, the US ambassador to the UK has insisted.
Despite the threat of widespread protests, the US ambassador Woody Johnson confirmed Trump would “definitely be coming to London”. He told LBC radio on Friday: “He’s very thick-skinned. He knows what he wants to do and he speaks in a very clear and unusual way from most politicians.

The US President had been warned by London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, that he should expect to see demonstrators during his “working visit” to the UK on July 13.
Johnson told radio host Nick Ferrari it would be “all hands on deck” as preparations are made for the visit. He said: “He will definitely be coming to London.”
Reports suggest Trump will meet the Queen during the visit.

Downing Street confirmed on Thursday that Theresa May would hold bi-lateral talks with Trump and that further details will be “set out in due course”.

Trump’s visit will fall short of the full-blown “state visit”, which sparked outrage when it was suggested last year.
As long-threatened mass demonstrations began to be organised and politicians stated they would join in, London mayor Khan tweeted: “If he comes to London, President Trump will experience an open and diverse city that has always chosen unity over division and hope over fear.
“He will also no doubt see that Londoners hold their liberal values of freedom of speech very dear.”

The announcement of Trump’s trip comes after the president was offered a “state visit” to Britain after he was elected, which prompted a huge backlash and questions over whether it would actually happen.
His statements, particularly the pledge to ban Muslims from travelling to the US when he was running for election, prompted condemnation in Britain.

Trump also stoked a war of words with Khan, calling the Mayor “pathetic”. Khan later said Trump was behaving “like a 12-year-old”.
But the announcement has also revealed how some senior British politicians have changed their attitudes towards Trump.
Boris Johnson, who said in December 2015 “the only reason I wouldn’t go to some parts of New York is the real risk of meeting Donald Trump”, tweeted the news about the now-president’s trip was “fantastic”.

Biggest rally ‘ever’
Within an hour of the announcement, a Facebook event dedicated to a protest had gained 28,000 attendees.
Campaigners have previously said Trump would face the biggest rally “ever seen”, should he come to the UK.
A Number 10 spokesperson said: “The President of the United States will visit the UK on 13 July. He will hold bilateral talks with the Prime Minister during his visit. Further details will be set out in due course.”

In January, Trump cancelled a visit to London to open the new American embassy, saying he ditched the trip because the US had got a “bad deal” on the construction of the new building. “Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO!” he tweeted.
However it was reported by Bloomberg news that Trump had told the Prime Minister, Theresa May, that he would not visit the UK unless she could guarantee he would not face protests.
Left-wing commentator Owen Jones, who has been vocal in his criticism of the US President, said he would be leading the protests.

He told Sky News: “It’s time to speak out against the bigotry, the anti-Muslim hatred, and misogyny this man represents.
“The majority of people in this country want a good relationship with the United States, but we abhor everything that Trump stands for.”

Last year, tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in London, Glasgow, Birmingham and throughout the UK - waving banners and placards - in response to the 90-day travel ban issued by Trump to seven largely Muslim countries.
After the Trump visit was confirmed on Thursday, Labour MP David Lammy asked: “Anybody any good at making placards?”

Jo Swinson, Liberal Democrat deputy leader and Foreign Affairs spokesperson said the “scaled-down trip must not be met with scaled-down protests”.
She said: “Protesting against a man with dangerous, misogynistic and racist views is our responsibility. It is our opportunity to stand in solidarity with all the people he has abused and denigrated.”
Kate Allen, director of Amnesty International UK, said “thousands of our supporters” will “very definitely be making our voices heard”.
She added: “In the 15 months of his presidency, we’ve seen a deeply disturbing human rights roll-back – including the discriminatory travel ban, his reckless announcement on Jerusalem, and harmful policies on refugees, women’s rights and climate change.

Here are some early signals on his visit.,"LONDON — President Trump’s on-again, off-again visit to Britain is on again for this summer.
But Mr. Trump most likely will not get the honors of a traditional state visit, a highly ceremonial and very British affair, when he arrives on July 13.
Here is what he can expect.
What will be missing?
Invitations for state visits, extended by Queen Elizabeth II on the advice of the government, are rare, honorific and convey a strong relationship between Britain and the country of the visiting foreign leader.
But just how different in substance such visits are from working or official visits is less obvious.
A state visit is a firmly structured event over four days, including talks, pageants, a banquet and a visit outside London. A working visit does not include the pomp, but still features most of the rest, in a more flexible way. (The schedule of a state visit would make it difficult to find time for a golfing stopover in Scotland, for example.)",2018-04-27 16:57:54,,2024-05-15 18:51:09,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/28/world/europe/28statevisit1/28statevisit1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=036fa185a7051ad8b4e45a1b5145778b23178e5c5bcf76070884b57973d9c83a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,en

“The President of the United States will visit the UK on 13 July. He will hold bilateral talks with the Prime Minister during his visit,” 10 Downing Street said in a statement. “Further details will be set out in due course.”
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders confirmed the visit to reporters at the White House. While no agenda was given, it is likely that Brexit, Syria, tariffs and a U.S.-U.K. trade deal will be among the topics discussed by the two leaders during Trump's working visit.
A state visit to the U.K. was proposed in January 2017 when May visited the White House, but the resulting controversy and threat of mass protests from left-wing activists appeared to put such a visit on ice.
In January this year, Trump nixed a February visit to the U.K. to open the U.S. Embassy, reportedly due to the cost of the building.
Trump and May last met in Davos, Switzerland in January. During that visit, Trump dismissed concerns of strained ties between the two countries, just weeks after a controversy erupted over Trump’s retweeting of videos by a far-right British group of alleged Muslim crimes.
“[May] and myself have had a really great relationship, although some people don't necessarily believe that,"" Trump said in Davos. But I can tell you it's true. I have a tremendous respect for the prime minister and the job she's doing. And I think the feeling is mutual from the standpoint of liking each other a lot.”
“We are very much joined at the hip when it comes to the military. We have the same ideas, the same ideals,” he said before turning to speak to May directly. “There's nothing that would happen to you that we won't be there to fight for you.”

May was similarly glowing in her praise of what she called a “really special relationship between the U.K. and the United States.”
May has repeatedly come under fire for her outreach to Trump. When the U.S., U.K. and France joined forces to bomb Syria this month, hard-left Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn accused May of bowing to “the whims of a U.S. President.”

The visit, which is expected to be a so-called working visit rather than full state visit reciprocates the trip made by UK Prime Minister Theresa May to see President Trump shortly after his inauguration in 2017.
It was initially planned that President Trump’s first visit to the UK would be a full state visit, with all the pomp and pageantry that entails, however the trip was postponed and finally apparently ditched when talk of a working visit became prominent instead. The invitation to the U.S. President for a state visit to the United Kingdom remains open.
It has been claimed one of the reasons for the delay in the visit is the threat of protests against the President should he visit London. Foremost among those opposing President Trump’s visit is London Mayor Sadiq Khan, a self-confessed “big fan” of Hillary Clinton, who has talked up the potential for protests on several occasions and added his own words against President Trump.
Breitbart London reported in 2017 on Khan’s remarks, when he said it it wouldn’t be “appropriate for our government to roll out the red carpet” to President Trump, complaining his policies “go[es] against everything we stand for.”
Praising London’s “great history” of protest, Khan has said he had no doubt “there will be some people who will want to express their views loudly and peacefully to the President”.
Although when the visit by President Trump first appeared to have been called off Khan welcomed the news, he now seems to have moderated his tone somewhat. Khan remarked in January that: “It appears that President Trump got the message from the many Londoners who love and admire America and Americans but find his policies and actions the polar opposite of our city’s values of inclusion, diversity and tolerance.
“His visit next month would without doubt have been met by mass peaceful protests. This just reinforces what a mistake it was for Theresa May to rush and extend an invitation of a state visit in the first place.”
By contrast to his previous promises of an unwelcoming London, today Mayor Khan took to Twitter to call the city “open”, and apparently without irony in an age of advancing censorship said that Londoners treasured freedom of speech.",2018-04-26 17:46:48,,2024-05-15 18:51:09,https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/04/Trump-Theresa.png,en

They’re coming anyway.","LOADING ERROR LOADING
SAN DIEGO ― President Donald Trump whipped himself into a fury earlier this month after learning that a caravan of hundreds of Central Americans was traveling through Mexico, planning to seek asylum in the United States. Shortly after learning about it, he mobilized the National Guard. He railed against what he viewed as a “crisis” at the border, despite the fact that illegal entries have plummeted to their lowest level since 1971. The secretary of homeland security issued a statement likening the caravan’s organizers to “smugglers” and the attorney general threatened to prosecute them.
But hundreds of participants in the caravan made their way to the U.S.-Mexico border on Sunday anyway. And despite Trump’s fulminations against them, it’s unclear whether his administration has any practical way to stop them from crossing in the coming days.

The caravan’s organizers, immigrant rights activists and legal observers marched toward International Friendship Park, which straddles the U.S.-Mexico border, as the caravan’s participants marched from Tijuana to San Diego on Sunday morning.

On the U.S. side of the border, a group of about 100 people chanted, “No borders! No wall! Sanctuary for all!” as they marched along the beach toward the port of entry. Roughly 200 of their counterparts in Mexico gathered in front of the metal fencing that divides the two countries, with more than a dozen people hoisting themselves atop the barrier.
“We have to push back against this administration,” demonstrator Laiken Jordahl, a borderlands campaigner for the nonprofit Center for Biological Diversity, told HuffPost. “Its culture of hate, bigotry and fear cannot be accepted. The administration doesn’t even talk to us, we had to come out and march.”

Another demonstrator, Roberto Saravia from Los Angeles, said: “This goes back further than the Trump administration. I find it ridiculous that any time there is an issue in the U.S., immigrants get scapegoated, they get mistreated, they get criminalized just for existing. This border is just a divide that shouldn’t be here and I want to see it gone ― it shouldn’t divide us.”
By Sunday afternoon, a group of about 150 of the caravan’s members had begun crossing into the U.S., along with legal advisers, organizers said.
But U.S. Customs and Border Protection warned it would limit the number of asylum-seekers making claims at the San Ysidro port of entry. “Depending upon port circumstances at the time of arrival, those individuals may need to wait in Mexico as CBP officers work to process those already within our facilities,” CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said in a statement.
The 150 migrants, many of whom were children, spent the night sleeping on the ground outside, waiting to present their claims to U.S. immigration officials. By Monday morning, they had yet to speak to immigration officials and remained on the Mexican side of the border, organizers said.
“They’re using the excuse of capacity to keep people from coming,” said Nicole Ramos, an attorney with the nonprofit group Al Otro Lado, who has provided legal services to the migrants traveling with the caravan. “The people that are waiting outside are children, infants, a disabled woman who relies on her mother to take care of all her needs, trans women ― these are the most vulnerable asylum seekers. What the U.S. is doing is creating a humanitarian crisis that doesn’t need to be created.”

The Trump administration is hoping that it won’t have to let the migrants into the U.S. at all. And his administration’s threats appear to be dissuading some. Between 150 and 200 Central American migrants plan to present asylum claims in the coming days, organizers said, while roughly another 150 have yet to decide whether to cross.
But for all the noise and slow-walking of the asylum seekers’ claims, it remains to be seen whether the White House’s actions do anything to push away those who do make asylum claims.
Trump’s ire at the caravan stems from larger concerns he’s expressed since he first started running for president three years ago. He wants the U.S. to stop releasing unauthorized immigrants caught at the border with notices to appear in immigration court instead of uniformly detaining or deporting them — a practice he and his supporters disparagingly call “catch and release.” Attorney General Jeff Sessions is one of his most enthusiastic partners in that project.
Unfortunately for them, ending the practice is not currently possible under U.S. law. When space in detention centers runs out, there’s simply no place to put people who can’t be quickly deported. Many immigrants from Mexico can be deported quickly. But many of the people crossing the border these days are Central American children and families, who aren’t as easy to deport — and generally can’t be detained for long. Unaccompanied children must be released to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, and the mothers cannot usually be locked up with their kids for longer than three weeks due to a federal court order. Migrants have a right to apply for asylum, whether or not they get detained in the process. And immigrants who get picked up within the interior of the country often qualify for bond hearings.

None of this matters to the Trump administration, whose actions and statements have likened the arrival of a few hundred Central Americans seeking asylum to a national security crisis. In an attempt to deter them, Trump mobilized the National Guard to help patrol the four Southwest border states, despite the fact that its presence will be purely ornamental — the National Guard can’t make immigration arrests, and the caravan’s members plan to travel through legal ports of entry.
Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen chipped in with a similarly aggressive but toothless statement last Wednesday, saying the department was “monitoring” the caravan’s movements. She encouraged asylum-seekers to stay in Mexico.
“Let me be clear,” Nielsen’s statement read. “We will enforce the immigration laws as set forth by Congress. If you enter our country illegally, you have broken the law and will be referred for prosecution. If you make a false immigration claim, you have broken the law and will be referred for prosecution. If you assist or coach an individual in making a false immigration claim, you have broken the law and will be referred for prosecution.”
Nielsen’s repeated statements targeting the caravan met with criticism from Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), the ranking member of the House Committee on Homeland Security.

“It’s overkill,” Thompson told HuffPost. “You would have expected [Trump] to have been briefed by intelligence officials exactly who was headed this way. … We know who they are. We know where they are. And we even know why they’re coming. So to try to elevate this into some heightened sense of threat, it just didn’t measure up.”

Sessions had his own response to the caravan, issuing a statement Monday saying he’d “directed our U.S. Attorneys at the border to take whatever immediate action to ensure that we have sufficient prosecutors available.”
It’s unclear what practical consequences any of these threats will have. The people whom Nielsen accuses of “coaching” the caravan’s members are lawyers and immigrant rights advocates counseling migrants about the process for claiming asylum. And crossing through a legal port of entry to ask for asylum, as the caravan’s members plan to do, doesn’t expose them to prosecution, as Sessions contends.
“It’s typical anti-immigrant fear-mongering,” said Alex Mensing, a project coordinator for the caravan’s main organizing group, Pueblos Sin Fronteras. “The right-wing media and the administration have been trying really hard to make it look like there are no legitimate asylum-seekers, and that’s just not true. And it’s not for them to decide anyway.”

And I’ll build them very inexpensively.” This was President Trump’s campaign announcement in June of 2015. Since then, President Trump’s efforts to build his long-touted wall have run into political realities. He doesn’t have the funding, and he couldn’t reach a compromise. “Look, I made it so, so clear to the president that there is not going to be a wall.” And his voter base is beginning to take notice. “Right now, if I were a betting woman, I don’t think we’re getting a wall.” So Trump instead has tried to use a series of distractions to get around the fact that his border barrier is running behind. President Trump had eight wall prototypes built near the border. But that’s where construction has stalled. These monoliths stand as a $20 million testament to his ambitions, but not much more. President Trump has repeatedly stated that construction is already under way for the wall. “We need the wall. We’ve started building the wall.” “We’re going to have the wall. We’ve already started building it.” “We started building our wall. I’m so proud of it.” But it’s almost entirely routine maintenance being done on existing sections of the wall, plus 33 miles of new fencing. When efforts to fund the wall failed, President Trump said he wanted the National Guard deployed, a move he said was significant. “Until we can have a wall and proper security, we’re going to be guarding our border with the military. That’s a big step. We really haven’t done that before, or certainly not very much before.” But this is not a dramatic move. Both President Obama and President Bush did the same during their terms. Trump suggested the military could pay for the wall with part of their budget, a proposal with few backers. “We can’t rob money and resources from the military that so desperately needs them at a time of growing international crisis.” President Trump said he was willing to compromise for wall funding in the 2018 budget bill in exchange for protecting young undocumented immigrants known as DACA recipients. “The Democrats would not do it.” But in reality, Trump was the one who ended the DACA program in the first place. Trump has tried various ways of getting Mexico to pay, including a border tax on Mexican goods or through renegotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement, also known as Nafta. But Mexico has yet to pay a dime. “Isn’t it true at this point that Mexico is just not going to pay for that wall?” “I’m not going to go beyond what the president’s already said. I think he still has plans to look at potential ways for that to happen.” But this kind of hedging is a far cry from Trump’s original promise. “I will have Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words.”",2018-04-29 17:26:41,,2024-05-15 18:51:10,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/30/world/30mexico-caravan-sub1/30mexico-caravan-sub1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=8d108eb5d9e140ebeb9107cfb691ce56e3b0a0a0b1daf2d34df5e37ff1cc47e6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,en

According to the Associated Press, U.S. immigration lawyers are telling caravan participants who traveled through Mexico to the border with San Diego that they face possible separation from their children and lengthy detentions.
""We are the bearers of horrible news,"" Los Angeles lawyer Nora Phillips told the AP during a break from legal workshops for the migrants at three Tijuana, Mexico, locations where about 20 lawyers gave free information and advice. ""That's what good attorneys are for.""
President Donald Trump and members of his Cabinet have been tracking the caravan, calling it a threat to the U.S. since it started March 25 in the Mexican city of Tapachula, near the Guatemala border. They have promised a stern, swift response. And the president has been critical of the caravan's steady approach to the U.S. And he has tweeted about it in strong, critical language.
""Mexico has the absolute power not to let these large “Caravans” of people enter their country. They must stop them at their Northern Border, which they can do because their border laws work, not allow them to pass through into our country, which has no effective border laws,"" he tweeted earlier this month.
In a statement Saturday, Chief Patrol Agent Rodney Scott said there had been several attempted illegal entries by people associated with the caravan.
Over the past 24-hours several groups of people associated with the Central American Caravan have illegally entered the United States without immigration documents by climbing over the dilapidated scrap metal border fence on either side of the San Ysidro Port of Entry,"" he said. ""In several of these incidents, children as young as 4-years-old, and in one case a pregnant female, were detected entering the United States illegally through a dark, treacherous canyon that is notorious for human and drug smuggling. As a father myself, I find it unconscionable that anyone would expose a child to these dangerous conditions, especially when there is a legitimate Port of Entry within a few miles of these dangerous canyons.""
He also urged those contemplating illegal entry to ""think before you act. If anyone has encouraged you to illegally enter the United States, or make any false statements to U.S. government officials, they are giving you bad advice and they are placing you and your family at risk. We are a very welcoming country but just like your own house, we expect everyone to enter through our front door, and answer questions honestly.""
WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE MASS BORDER CROSSING
For their part, the AP reported, many of the immigrants appear ready to confront the U.S. response and potential hardships head-on.
Kenia Elizabeth Avila, 35, appeared shaken after the volunteer attorneys told her Friday that temperatures may be cold in temporary holding cells and that she could be separated from her three children, ages 10, 9 and 4.
But she said in an interview with the wire service that returning to her native El Salvador would be worse. She fled for reasons she declined to discuss.
""If they're going to separate us for a few days, that's better than getting myself killed in my country,"" she said.
Lawyers who went to Tijuana denied any coaching of the roughly 400 people in the caravan who recently arrived in the Mexican city, camping out in shelters near some of the city's seedier bars and bordellos.
Some migrants received counseling to assess the merits of their cases, and groups of the migrants with their children playing nearby were told how asylum works.
Asylum-seekers are typically held up to three days at the border and then turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. If they pass an initial screening, they may be detained or fitted with ankle monitors and released.
Nearly 80 percent of asylum-seekers passed the initial screening from October through December, the latest numbers available, the AP said, but few are likely to eventually win asylum.
Jose Cazares, 31, said he faced death threats in Honduras because a gang member suspected of killing the mother of his children learned one of Cazares' sons reported the matter to the authorities.
""One can always make up for lost time with a child, but if they kill him, you can't,"" he said to the AP outside a tent in a migrant shelter near the border barriers.

Members of the caravan gathered at Friendship Park in Tijuana, where some will have to remain as they wait to be processed by U.S. authorities at the San Ysidro Port of Entry, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
“Depending on port circumstances at the time of arrival, individuals may need to wait in Mexico as CBP officers work to process those already within our facilities,” said Pete Flores, director of field operations for CBP in San Diego.
The effort was organized by Pueblos Sin Fronteras, translated from Spanish as People Without Borders, which is not the same group as the Washington-based non-profit that provides computer classes to international residents of the District of Columbia.
Upon reaching the border, migrants are expected to turn themselves in peacefully at the port of entry and ask for asylum.
“People who have a legitimate fear of persecution under US law have a right to present their case,” said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, top Democrat on the House subcommittee on immigration. “That’s not a violation of immigration law. That’s a part of immigration law.”
The group marching toward the border Sunday is expected to be the largest to approach border officials and demonstrators arrived at both sides of the border fence Sunday in support of the caravan.
CBP Chief Patrol Agent Rodney S. Scott said several groups of people associated with the caravan illegally entered the United States by climbing over a metal fence.
“We are a very welcoming country but just like your own house, we expect everyone to enter through our front door, and answer questions honestly,” Scott said.
Similar migrant groups have made their way toward the border within the past few years but this group has faced vocal opposition from President Donald Trump, whose administration warned of arrests as about 130 immigrants arrived at the border Wednesday.
“This is not ideal for us to have this many people, this much publicity,” leader of the Pueblo Sin Fronteras caravan Irineo Mujica said.
Mujica added “it’s been really really good that we are able to see what is the problem,” highlighting the violence that prompted members of the caravan to seek asylum.",2018-04-29 14:17:50,,2024-05-15 18:51:11,https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg,en

The extension reflects concerns by the Trump administration of a swift retaliation on American products by European Union nations, and will also give the Trump administration more breathing room to work on a separate trade battle with China.
The 25 percent tariffs on steel and 10 percent on aluminum were set to go into effect on Tuesday and had set off a global scramble by nations trying to secure permanent exemptions. The administration, which granted temporary exemptions to a handful of countries in March, said it had reached initial agreements with Argentina, Australia and Brazil that would allow them to avoid the tariffs, at least for now. Details of those agreements will be finalized in the next 30 days, the White House said.
President Trump’s decision puts off a move that could have enraged key American allies at a delicate moment, as the United States heads toward tricky negotiations with North Korea and is considering abandoning the Iran nuclear deal over the objections of European Union leaders. Despite the president’s tough stance on trade, many of his advisers are leery of initiating trade clashes that could destabilize stock markets and put other political goals at risk, like updating the North American Free Trade Agreement. The White House is also dispatching a delegation of top officials to Beijing this week to try to soothe tensions in its trade battle there.",2018-05-01 00:02:05,,2024-05-15 18:51:12,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/01/business/01dc-tariffs-print/01dc-tariffs-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=7dfb30e8d18d7c3a71651390322804fc74f6ad9ebe799c6fde956275c3b259eb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,en

The White House also said it had reached an agreement with South Korea on steel imports following discussions on a revised trade agreement, the outlines of which were previously announced by U.S. and South Korean officials. The administration also announced that it had reached agreements in principle with Argentina, Australia and Brazil on steel and aluminum that will be finalized shortly.
""In all of these negotiations,"" the White House statement said, ""the Administration is focused on quotas that will restrain imports, prevent transshipment, and protect the national security.""
President Trump was considering whether to permanently exempt the EU and Mexico, Canada, Australia, Argentina and Brazil from steel and aluminum tariffs that his administration imposed last month. The White House provided temporary exemptions in March and had until the end of Monday to decide whether to extend them.
The EU has said if it loses its exemption it will retaliate with its own tariffs on U.S. goods imported to Europe.
The confrontation stems from the president's decision in March to slap tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on imported aluminum. Trump justified the action by saying it was needed to protect American metal producers from unfair competition and bolster national security. But the announcement, which followed an intense internal White House debate, triggered harsh criticism from Democrats and some Republicans and roiled financial markets.
At the time, Trump excluded the European Union, Mexico, Canada, Australia, Argentina and Brazil from the tariffs.
That meant the steel tariff covered just 30 percent of all imports, according to Oxford Economics. If all the exemptions were ended, it would have deepened the impact of the tariffs on American companies that use steel and potentially affect financial markets. Stock prices fell nearly 2 percent when the tariffs were announced.
Two people familiar with the process said the Trump administration had been considering whether to provide a short-term extension of the exemptions to allow for more time to review the countries' efforts to secure permanent exemptions.
One of the officials said the U.S. trade representative has been overseeing the process for all of the countries except for the European Union, whose tariffs are being evaluated by the Commerce Department.
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations.
The EU and others had been asked to spell out what limits they could accept on the amount of steel they export to the United States, how they would address the issue of excess production of steel and aluminum and how they would support the U.S. before international bodies like the World Trade Organization. Security relationships with the U.S. have also been part of the criteria.
South Korea agreed to limit its exports to the United States as part of broader discussions involved in updating its bilateral trade agreement with the U.S. and was granted a permanent exemption.
China, Japan and Russia haven't received exemptions from the duties. That will likely reduce steel shipments from those countries over time. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said late Friday that quotas on imports from Europe and other countries are necessary so imports from those countries don't simply replace Chinese imports. The goal of the tariffs is to reduce total steel imports and boost U.S. production, Ross said.
""If you let everybody back out of the tariff, and you let them out of any kind of quota, how would you ever reduce the imports here?"" Ross asked at a conference of business journalists. Ross is set to discuss the issue Monday with EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom.
Germany, the EU's largest steel exporter to the U.S., accounted for about 5 percent of U.S. steel imports last year. South Korea made up the largest share, shipping about 13 percent of U.S. imports, according to an American Iron and Steel Institute analysis of government data.
The EU has compiled a list of retaliatory tariffs worth about $3.5 billion it will impose if its steel and aluminum isn't exempted.
European leaders have resisted the idea of a quota. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a statement Sunday that she discussed the issue with French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Theresa May after returning from a White House visit Friday.
The three European leaders ""agreed that the U.S. ought not to take any trade measures against the European Union,"" which is ""resolved to defend its interests within the multilateral trade framework,"" Merkel's statement said.
In her meeting with Trump, Merkel said, she saw little progress in obtaining permanent exemptions. ""The decision lies with the president,"" she said Friday.
In a separate trade battle with China, the United States has threatened to impose tariffs on $150 billion of Chinese goods in retaliation for what it argues are Beijing's unfair trade practices and its requirement that U.S. companies turn over technology in exchange for access to its market. The White House also wants China to agree to reduce its $375 billion goods trade surplus with the U.S.
China has said it would subject $50 billion of U.S. goods to tariffs if the U.S. taxes its products. Trump has announced that an administration delegation led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and trade adviser Peter Navarro will visit Beijing for negotiations on Thursday and Friday this week.
In addition to Mnuchin, Lighthizer, Ross and Navarro, the group will include economic adviser Larry Kudlow, U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad and Everett Eissenstat, deputy assistant to the president for International Economic Affairs.
""We're going to have very frank discussions,"" Mnuchin in an interview broadcast Monday on Fox Business.
Most analysts, however, think it's unlikely the talks will reach permanent agreements and will more likely mark the start of longer-term negotiations.

The report came just hours before tariff exemptions were due to expire at midnight for the EU, Canada, Mexico and others, after which the major exporters would face punishing import duties of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum.
The postponement would effectively leave the exemptions in place.
Trump announced the tariffs on March 8, but exempted the European Union later that month.
The Trump administration has justified the tariffs — aimed primarily at Chinese overproduction — on national security grounds and told trading partners they must make concessions to win permanent exemptions.
The EU has insisted it will not negotiate without first obtaining a permanent exemption.
The US official, speaking to the Journal on condition of anonymity, also said that the Trump administration would announce later Monday it had reached a deal to exempt South Korea from the tariffs.
Trump is working with South Korean President Moon Jae-in ahead of the US leader’s expected summit with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un in the coming weeks.

They deal chiefly with the president’s high-profile firings of the F.B.I. director and his first national security adviser, his treatment of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and a 2016 Trump Tower meeting between campaign officials and Russians offering dirt on Hillary Clinton.
But they also touch on the president’s businesses; any discussions with his longtime personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, about a Moscow real estate deal; whether the president knew of any attempt by Mr. Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to set up a back channel to Russia during the transition; any contacts he had with Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser who claimed to have inside information about Democratic email hackings; and what happened during Mr. Trump’s 2013 trip to Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant.
Mr. Trump said on Twitter on Tuesday that it was “disgraceful” that questions the special counsel would like to ask him were publicly disclosed, and he incorrectly noted that there were no questions about collusion. The president also said collusion was a “phony” crime.",2018-05-01 00:46:23,,2024-05-15 18:51:14,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/01/reader-center/01DC-MUELLER/01DC-MUELLER-facebookJumbo-v5.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=c518c28b04b0ca0949f6e3d362529b358df5db3dd2788ab00d8d162b28c57977&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,en
8,RR,http://www.breitbart.com/news/mueller-hints-at-obstruction-in-trump-questions-report/,Mueller hints at obstruction in Trump questions: report,Washington (AFP) – Special Counsel Robert Mueller has submitted questions to the White House that indicate a focus on whether President Donald Trump,"Washington (AFP) – Special Counsel Robert Mueller has submitted questions to the White House that indicate a focus on whether President Donald Trump tried to obstruct a probe into Russian interference, The New York Times reported Monday.
The questions also show Mueller wants to find out what Trump knew about links between members of his presidential campaign and Russia, including a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower with a Russian lawyer offering damaging information on election rival Hillary Clinton, the Times said.
And they indicate that Mueller wants to know if Trump offered a pardon to his former national security advisor, Michael Flynn, who has already been charged by Mueller with lying and is believed to be cooperating with the investigation.
The questions are the clearest signal yet that Mueller has enough circumstantial evidence to suspect the president of obstruction, and also has reason to believe Trump might have known of the Russia links.
But there is no indication whether Trump is now an official suspect of the year-old probe, or that Mueller has found evidence of active collusion with the Russians, which Trump vehemently denies.
The Times obtained a list of questions it said Mueller’s team read over the telephone to Trump’s legal team, which compiled them into a list.
The Times said it obtained the list from someone outside Trump’s legal team.
Mueller’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Since at least early this year, Mueller has discussed the possibility of interviewing Trump for the investigation, according to the president’s attorneys.
But they appear to have been divided on how and how much Trump should cooperate.
Two weeks ago, Trump recruited to his legal team former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, who said he would try to reach a deal with Mueller on how the president would cooperate with the probe.
Most of the questions reported by the Times ask what Trump knew of certain events, like the June 2016 meeting with the Russian lawyer, or what was he thinking when he did or said something, like firing former FBI director James Comey.
“When did you become aware of the Trump Tower meeting?” one question asks.
“What efforts were made to reach out to Mr Flynn about seeking immunity or possible pardon?” goes another.
Mueller also wants to know if Trump discussed with any campaign staff arranging a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
While none of the questions are accusatory, they could carry the risk of Trump being trapped in a lie if any of several former campaign staff already indicted by Mueller have provided evidence to the contrary.",2018-04-30 20:37:59,,2024-05-15 18:51:16,https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/04/wi/afp/30/1vtg6e_special-counsel-robert-mueller-left-has-submitted-questions-white-house.jpg,en

The administration echoed the claims made by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday in a dramatic PowerPoint presentation, suggesting he had coordinated it with the White House to set the stage for President Trump’s decision about whether to rip up the agreement negotiated by his predecessor, Barack Obama.
Mr. Trump has threatened to scrap the deal as soon as May 12, if Britain, France and Germany do not agree to wholesale changes. The White House cited Mr. Netanyahu’s theatrical presentation — based on documents taken from an Iranian warehouse in a nighttime raid in January — as further proof of the agreement’s flaws.
“The deal was made on a completely false pretense,” the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said at her daily briefing. “Iran lied on the front end. They were dishonest actors. So the deal that was made was made on things that weren’t accurate, and we have a big problem with that.”",2018-05-02 01:21:30,,2024-05-15 18:51:18,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/02/world/02dc-israel-alpha/02dc-israel-alpha-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=481aa372319d2665eb619863c5e544faf013ebbe607afcd6755ee8eebd68be3c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,en

Netanyahu used a televised address Monday to revealed that Israel had obtained hundreds of thousands of Iranian files from a “dilapidated” compound where the regime had allegedly hid its nuclear weapons research archive.
The files, Netanyahu said, showed that Iran had lied to the world about its covert work on developing nuclear weapons, including designs for a nuclear bomb, research on nuclear warheads, and development of testing sites.
Jennifer Jacobs of Bloomberg News tweeted
NEW: US official confirms what Netanyahu said. Israel shared the Iranian files with the U.S.
And the U.S. verified the material as authentic, I’m told. @netanyahu @IsraeliPM — Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) April 30, 2018
It was unclear if U.S. intelligence had verified the substance of the allegations made by Netanyahu on the basis of the files.
Netanyahu’s presentation came just days before a highly-anticipated and self-imposed May 12 deadline for the Trump administration to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, and minutes before President Donald Trump addressed reporters in the Rose Garden alongside Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari.
In response to a question by Jordan Fabian of The Hill, President Trump said that he had watched some of Netanyahu’s presentation, and implied that he found it convincing, but would not yet announce his plans — though he said he was open to re-negotiating the deal.
Earlier in the day, Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, reportedly said: “The Iran nuclear deal is no longer sustainable for Iran in its present form, without regard to a US exit.”
